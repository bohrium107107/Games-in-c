## 🧠 How It Works

### 🎯 Forced Board Rule
Your move determines which small board your opponent must play in next.  
If that board is already completed, your opponent gets a free move.

### 🔄 Swap Power
When you win a small board:
- You may swap it with any other board.
- Each player can use this power only once per game.
- Includes visual animation.
